# Creation of a cube with pivot

Create a new entity in the entity menu and give it a name, here "myCube".
In the component menu add a "**RenderObject**", a "**Transform**" and a "**RigidBody**" to your entity.

To display the cube you now need to load its graphic asset.
Use the "Save/Load" menu and select "Load asset".
A cube asset can be found by default under **editor/asset/cube.obj**.
If you want to use your own assets, Pivot is able to load **.obj** and **.gltf**.

A window confirms the successful loading of your asset.
You have made your first cube in the pivot engine.
## Modify the cube 

We are now going to use the component menu to modify the varialbles of our cube.
The "transform" component has built-in tools to modify its value without using the component menu.

### Moving
Moving an entity can be done by interacting with the axis present in our entity or by directly modifying its position values in the component menu.

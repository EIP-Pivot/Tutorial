# LOAD

After pressing Load, you will be redirected to your file explorer. Select the scene to load and confirm with [enter]. A confirmation message similar to that of the backup will confirm the loading of your scene.

Once the scene is loaded, it must be selected in the editor's menu.

## Launch pivot with a predefined scene

Adding the path of a scene as argument to the engine launch allows to load this scene in the engine.

It will then replace the "Default" scene.
